        * This is a example of implementation from factory method.
        *
        * Pros: You avoid coupling
        *       Single responsabilty principle
        *       Open/Closed principle
        *
        * Cons: The code may become more complicated since you need to introduce a lot of new subclasses to implement the pattern.
        *       The best case scenario is when youâ€™re introducing the pattern into an existing hierarchy of creator classes.
